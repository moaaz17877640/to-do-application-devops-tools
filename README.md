# To-Do Application with DevOps Tools

## Description
This repository contains a To-Do Application designed to demonstrate the integration of modern DevOps tools and practices, including Helm, Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, and cloud architecture. The project showcases containerized deployment, infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable cloud-based solutions.

The application provides users with the ability to manage tasks efficiently through a user-friendly interface. It is built with modern software development practices, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and reliability.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Containerized Application**: Deployed using Docker containers.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Provisioned with Terraform for consistent and repeatable infrastructure setup.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Managed through Helm charts for application orchestration.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated builds, tests, and deployments through Jenkins.
- **Cloud-Ready Architecture**: Designed for deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Scalability**: Leverages Kubernetes to scale based on demand.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated tools for application monitoring and centralized logging.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: [Specify if applicable, e.g., React, Vue.js]
- **Backend**: [Specify if applicable, e.g., Node.js, Django]
- **Database**: [Specify database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL]
- **DevOps Tools**: 
  - **Docker**: For containerization.
  - **Helm**: For Kubernetes package management.
  - **Terraform**: To provision and manage infrastructure as code.
  - **Jenkins**: For continuous integration and delivery pipelines.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Supports AWS, Azure, or GCP for scalable deployments.

## Architecture
The project employs a microservices-based architecture with the following components:
- **Frontend**: User interface for task management.
- **Backend**: API for handling business logic and database operations.
- **Database**: Persistent storage for tasks (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Application and database pods managed through Helm charts.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins pipeline automating build, test, and deployment stages.
