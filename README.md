# To-Do Application with DevOps Tools

## Description
This repository contains a **To-Do Application** that demonstrates the integration of modern **DevOps tools and practices**, including **Helm**, **Docker**, **Terraform**, **Jenkins**, and **cloud architecture**. The project illustrates how to build, package, deploy, and manage an application efficiently in a cloud-native environment using containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and infrastructure as code (IaC).

The application provides users with a seamless experience for managing their tasks. It is designed following the principles of scalability, reliability, and maintainability, making it a great example of how to integrate software development with DevOps workflows.

## Features
- **Task Management**: 
  - Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
  - View a list of tasks with a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **Containerization**:
  - The application is fully containerized using **Docker**, ensuring portability and consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes-Orchestrated Deployment**:
  - Leverages **Helm charts** to deploy and manage the application in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines powered by **Jenkins** to ensure continuous integration and delivery.
- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  - Infrastructure provisioning and management are automated using **Terraform**, enabling repeatable and consistent setups.
- **Cloud-Native Ready**:
  - The architecture is designed for deployment on cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
- **Scalability**:
  - The application can be scaled horizontally or vertically using Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Integrated solutions for monitoring and centralized logging to ensure observability and troubleshooting capabilities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: [Specify if applicable, e.g., React, Vue.js]
- **Backend**: [Specify if applicable, e.g., Node.js, Django]
- **Database**: [Specify database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL]
- **DevOps Tools**:
  - **Docker**: For containerization of the application.
  - **Helm**: For packaging and managing Kubernetes deployments.
  - **Terraform**: For provisioning and managing infrastructure as code.
  - **Jenkins**: For setting up CI/CD pipelines.
- **Cloud Platforms**:
  - The project is compatible with cloud environments like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**.
- **Kubernetes**:
  - Used for orchestrating and managing the containerized application.

## Architecture
This project adopts a **microservices-based architecture**, designed for scalability and maintainability. The key components include:
1. **Frontend**: The user-facing interface that interacts with the backend API.
2. **Backend**: Handles business logic and interacts with the database.
3. **Database**: Persistent storage for user tasks and data.
4. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Application and database containers are deployed as pods.
   - Managed using Helm charts for easy deployment and updates.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment phases.
6. **Cloud Infrastructure**:
   - Provisioned and managed using Terraform for consistent and repeatable setups.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes** (e.g., Minikube, AKS, EKS, or GKE)
- **Helm**
- **Terraform**
- **Jenkins**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moaaz17877640/to-do-application-devops-tools.git
cd to-do-application-devops-tools
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t todo-app .
```

### 3. Deploy the Application with Helm
1. Navigate to the Helm chart directory:
   ```bash
   cd helm-chart
   ```
2. Deploy the application using Helm:
   ```bash
   helm install todo-app ./ --namespace todo-namespace
   ```

### 4. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform
1. Navigate to the Terraform directory:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   ```
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### 5. Set Up Jenkins Pipeline
1. Open Jenkins and configure a new pipeline using the `Jenkinsfile` provided in this repository.
2. Trigger the pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment phases.

### 6. Access the Application
Once deployed, access the application through the provided URL or ingress point.

## Monitoring and Logging
- **Monitoring**:
  - The application integrates with monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time metrics and dashboards.
- **Logging**:
  - Centralized logging is implemented using tools like the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) or **Loki** for querying and analyzing logs.
